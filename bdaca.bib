	Abstract = {Past research suggests Facebook use is linked to perceptions of social capital, a concept that taps into the resources people gain from interactions with their social network. In this study, we examine a sample of public Facebook status updates (N=20,000) for instances in which users request a response from their network. These attempts to mobilize resources offer insight into the mechanisms through which Facebook is used for social capital conversion. After identifying mobilization requests (N=856), we categorize them by cost (i.e., effort needed to satisfy the request) and type (e.g., opinion, information, social coordination) in order to describe the prevalence of these requests and the extent to which they require effort on the part of the potential responders. Finally, we examine characteristics of these users and the linguistic characteristics of status updates that contain mobilization requests. Introduction},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a study of the life cycle of news articles posted online. We describe the interplay between website visitation patterns and social media reactions to news content. We show that we can use this hybrid observation method to characterize distinct classes of articles. We also find that social media reactions can help predict future visitation patterns early and accurately. We validate our methods using qualitative analysis as well as quantitative analysis on data from a large international news network, for a set of articles generating more than 3,000,000 visits and 200,000 social media reactions. We show that it is possible to model accurately the overall traffic articles will ultimately receive by observing the first ten to twenty minutes of social media reactions. Achieving the same prediction accuracy with visits alone would require to wait for three hours of data. We also describe significant improvements on the accuracy of the early prediction of shelf-life for news stories.},

@article{Trilling2015,
abstract = {While watching television, more and more citizens comment the program live on social media. This is especially interesting in the case of political debates, as viewers' comments might not only allow us to tap into public opinion, but they can also be an influential factor of their own and contribute to public discourse. This article analyzes how the TV debate between the candidates for chancellor during the German election campaign 2013 was discussed on Twitter. To do so, the transcript of the debate is linked to a set of N = 120,557 tweets containing the hashtag {\#}tvduell. The results indicate that the candidates were only to a minor degree successful in getting their topics to the Twitter debate. An optimistic reading of the results suggests that Twitter serves as a complement to draw attention to topics neglected in the official debate. A more pessimistic reading would point to the fact that the discourse on Twitter seems to be dominated by sarcastic or funny rather than by substantial content.},

@article{boyd2012,
	Abstract = { The era of Big Data has begun. Computer scientists, physicists, economists, mathematicians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, sociologists, and other scholars are clamoring for access to the massive quantities of information produced by and about people, things, and their interactions. Diverse groups argue about the potential benefits and costs of analyzing genetic sequences, social media interactions, health records, phone logs, government records, and other digital traces left by people. Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data analytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech? Will it transform how we study human communication and culture, or narrow the palette of research options and alter what `research' means? Given the rise of Big Data as a socio-technical phenomenon, we argue that it is necessary to critically interrogate its assumptions and biases. In this article, we offer six provocations to spark conversations about the issues of Big Data: a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology, analysis, and mythology that provokes extensive utopian and dystopian rhetoric. },

This paper explores the application of a quantitative approach to publicly available data collected from pornographic websites. Several analyses are applied to these digital traces with a focus on keywords describing videos and their underlying categorization systems. The analysis of a large network of tags shows that the accumulation of categories does not separate scripts from each other, but instead draws a multitude of significant paths between fuzzy categories. The datasets and tools we describe have been made publicly available for further study. }

@article{Kitchin2014,
abstract = {This article examines how the availability of Big Data, coupled with new data analytics, challenges established epistemologies across the sciences, social sciences and humanities, and assesses the extent to which they are engendering paradigm shifts across multiple disciplines. In particular, it critically explores new forms of empiricism that declare ‘the end of theory’, the creation of data-driven rather than knowledge-driven science, and the development of digital humanities and computational social sciences that propose radically different ways to make sense of culture, history, economy and society. It is argued that: (1) Big Data and new data analytics are disruptive innovations which are reconfiguring in many instances how research is conducted; and (2) there is an urgent need for wider critical reflection within the academy on the epistemological implications of the unfolding data revolution, a task that has barely begun to be tackled despite the rapid changes in research practices presently taking place. After critically reviewing emerging epistemological positions, it is contended that a potentially fruitful approach would be the development of a situated, reflexive and contextually nuanced epistemology.

	abstract = {ABSTRACTLatent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic models are increasingly being used in communication research. Yet, questions regarding reliability and validity of the approach have received little attention thus far. In applying LDA to textual data, researchers need to tackle at least four major challenges that affect these criteria: (a) appropriate pre-processing of the text collection; (b) adequate selection of model parameters, including the number of topics to be generated; (c) evaluation of the model's reliability; and (d) the process of validly interpreting the resulting topics. We review the research literature dealing with these questions and propose a methodology that approaches these challenges. Our overall goal is to make LDA topic modeling more accessible to communication researchers and to ensure compliance with disciplinary standards. Consequently, we develop a brief hands-on user guide for applying LDA topic modeling. We demonstrate the value of our approach with empirical data from an ongo...},

Our work is based on recent results in word embeddings that learn semantically mean-ingful representations for words from local co-occurrences in sentences. The WMD distance measures the dissimilarity between two text doc-uments as the minimum amount of distance that the embedded words of one document need to " travel " to reach the embedded words of another document. We show that this distance metric can be cast as an instance of the Earth Mover's Dis-tance, a well studied transportation problem for which several highly efficient solvers have been developed. Our metric has no hyperparameters and is straight-forward to implement. Further, we demonstrate on eight real world document classi-fication data sets, in comparison with seven state-of-the-art baselines, that the WMD metric leads to unprecedented low k-nearest neighbor docu-ment classification error rates.},

	abstract = {Word embeddings are ubiquitous in machine learning and natural language processing. Recent works show that the ge-ometry of the word embedding captures gender stereotypes. In this paper, we develop a framework to investigate the tem-poral dynamics of gender and ethnic stereotypes by analyzing how the embedding geometry changes over time. We apply this approach to analyze embeddings trained over 100 years of text data. Moreover, we integrate U.S. Census data over the 20th century and demonstrate that dynamics of the word embedding track closely with demographic and occupation shifts over time. We systematically quantify changes in the embeddings of various classes of occupations and adjectives and their relationship to gender and ethnic groups. While the overall embedding bias has been decreasing, specific occu-pations (e.g. intellectual professions) are still associated with males and adjectives for physical appearance are closer to fe-males. We show that our approach can robustly capture global shifts – e.g. the feminist movement in the 1960s and Asian immigration into the U.S. – as well as changes in the biases associated with specific words. Temporal analysis of word embeddings thus opens up a powerful new intersection be-tween machine learning and quantitative social science.

This type of analysis offers the opportunity to answer questions relating to causes and effects of media attention for issues and all kind of other content characteristics. Data that ask for a time series approach have become widely available during the past years, due to the rise of digital archives and social media such as Twitter and Facebook. This type of analysis allows for answering a set of interesting research questions and strong inferences about causal processes. Common challenges in time series analysis, relating to stationarity, accounting for a series' past and autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity are discussed. Two useful approaches, ARIMA and VAR, are introduced stepwise. An empirical example, dealing with intermedia agenda-setting between different newspapers in the Netherlands, demonstrates how both techniques can be applied and how they provide insightful answers to interesting research problems.",

	abstract = {Published with license by Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC {\textcopyright} 2017 [Joanna Strycharz, Nadine Strauss, and Damian Trilling] This study investigates the reciprocal relationships between the fluctuation of the closing prices of three companies listed on the Amsterdam exchange index, namely ING, Philips and Shell and online media coverage related to these firms for a period of two years (2014–2015). Automated content analysis methods were employed to analyze sentiment and emotionality and to identify corporate topics related to the companies. A positive relation of the amount of coverage and emotionality with the fluctuation of stock prices was detected for Shell and Philips. In addition, corporate topics were found to positively Granger cause stock price fluctuation, particularly for Philips. The study advances past research in showing that the prediction of stock price fluctuation based on media coverage can be improved by including sentiment, emotionality, and corporate topics. The findings inform strategic communication, and particularly investor relations, in suggesting that media attention, sentiment, and certain corporate topics are crucial when managing media relations and with regard to securing a fair evaluation of listed companies. Furthermore, the innovative research methods are useful for researchers and practitioners alike in showcasing how media coverage related to firms and their stock fluctuations can be identified and analyzed in a reproducible, hands-on and efficient manner.},

Among others, it has become increasingly popular to analyze the framing of news articles by means of statistical procedures. In this article, we investigate the conceptual validity of news frames that are inferred by a combination of k-means cluster analysis and automatic sentiment analysis. Furthermore, we test a way of improving statistical frame analysis such that revealed clusters of articles reflect the framing concept more closely. We do so by only using words from an article’s title and lead and by excluding named entities and words with a certain part of speech from the analysis. To validate revealed frames, we manually analyze samples of articles from the extracted clusters. Findings of our tests indicate that when following the proposed feature selection approach, the resulting clusters more accurately discriminate between articles with a different framing. We discuss the methodological and theoretical implications of our findings. }

We use datasets from a range of online sources that vary in the diversity and formality of the language used, and we apply different classifiers to extract information about the affective tone in these datasets. We first measure agreement (reliability test) and then compare their classifications with the benchmark of human coding (validity test). Our analyses show that validity and reliability vary with the formality and diversity of the text; we also show that ready-to-use methods leave much space for improvement when analyzing domain-specific content and that a machine-learning approach offers more accurate predictions across communication domains.},
