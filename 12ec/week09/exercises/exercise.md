# Exercise SML


1. Reproduce examples from the book for SML on the IMDB data (11.2, 11.3, 11.4) (check codefrombook.py if you do not want to type over the code)
2. Play around with dierent options! Can you tweak the models and make them even better? Take a look back at week 7 when we compared dierent vectorizers as well!
3. Download the file `train.csv` and `test.csv` from the module `Files week 9` on Canvas. Train a classier on them as well! (Data from Vermeer et al., 2020)
